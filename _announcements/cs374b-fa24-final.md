Best of luck! :)

The format was a little different than most ACM review sessions. We went through problems on Ryan Ziegler (HKN)'s cramming carnival sheet, the scribbles for which are [here](/assets/cs374b/fa24/final/pdf/cram_carn_scribs.pdf). The recording for the session is [here](https://illinois.zoom.us/rec/share/bySK9ZhCtzLQ-EAZXK5SlpjRSUdR-YJ8L4VS_FGp7--NfUmw0XLG7n3LL2XwNcaT.JoS1hbkduBnLlv7y?startTime=1734028269000). Sorry for the bit of stumbling- Ryan wrote some tricky and interesting questions (and we came up with answers on-the-fly ðŸ™ƒ)- they're more difficult than we expect your final is going to be. Consider looking through the slides and scribbles for the A section recording if you want a more full review.
