Prof. Mineyev of the mathematics department reached out to us, asking for us to share information about some research opportunities. His message is below:

> My name is Igor Mineyev, I am a professor of mathematics at the U of
> I. I am running [two IML projects in Spring
> 2025](https://iml.math.illinois.edu/spring-2025-iml-research-projects/)
> (the students will be registered for a Math 492 course). The projects
> involve creating and improving web-based games inspired by
> mathematical research, with the goal of engaging the public in
> mathematical concepts.
> 
>   
> 
> ## The two projects:
> 
>   
> 
> 1. **ColorTaiko!** A web-based game inspired by the Kaplansky conjectures in algebra. Tasks include improving the gameâ€™s performance
> and algorithms, adding new levels, and potentially exploring 3D
> visualization. â€¢ Details: [ColorTaiko
> Information](https://mineyev.web.illinois.edu/ColorTaiko!/) â€¢ Current
> Version: [Play
> ColorTaiko!](https://play.math.illinois.edu/ColorTaiko!) â€¢ Information
> about the game is also available by **clicking on the title** of the
> game within the game itself.
> 
> 2. **PathForms** A new project visualizing Nielsenâ€™s algorithm from geometric group theory. Players will manipulate paths on a graph in an
> interactive and visual way. â€¢ Information about the game will be
> available at [PathForms
> Information](https://mineyev.web.illinois.edu/PathForms/).
> 
>   
> 
> Both links are also accessible on my website: [Igor Mineyev's Math
> Page](https://mineyev.web.illinois.edu/).
> 
>   
> 
> ## Skills and Requirements:
> 
>   
> 
> * Familiarity with **JavaScript**, **React**, and generally with **algorithms** is helpful.
> 
> * Interest in game development, or mathematical visualization is welcome.
> 
> * These are creative projects. Bring your ideas on how to improve the games. You can also put participation in this project on your CV later
> on.
> 
>   
> 
> ## Course Information:
> 
>   
> 
> * Course: **Math 492**
> 
> * Faculty: Prof. Igor Mineyev
> 
> * Prerequisites: No advanced math background is needed. All mathematics will be explained during the meetings.
> 
> * Meetings: Weekly team meetings with additional collaboration during the week.
>

> ## How to Apply:
> 
>   
> 
> To see all IML projects for Spring 2025, including these, and to
> apply, visit:
> 
> ðŸ”— [IML Spring 2025 Research
> Projects](https://iml.math.illinois.edu/spring-2025-iml-research-projects/)
> 
>   
> 
> The deadline to apply is **before January 13, 2025**, but students
> should not wait. Apply as soon as possible.
