- title: Looking forward...
  content: Just to looking forward to what Academic Committee is planning for this semester, we hope to be running review sessions for CS374A and CS438 at minimum. CS374A review sessions will hopefully be hosted in a two-room format, where one room will be dedicated to a more lecture-style review session, and the other will be dedicated to a more office-hours style review.
